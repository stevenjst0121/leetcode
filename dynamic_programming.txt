Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.

1. Overlapping Subproblems
For exmaple, f(n) recursion solution may call f(m) multiple times

2. Optimal Substructure Property
Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

DP Methods
1. Top-down with Memoization
Recursion with memoization

2. Bottom-up with Tabulation
Tabulation is the opposite of the top-down approach and avoids recursion.
