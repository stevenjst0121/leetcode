BRAINSTORM TIPS FOR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
=======================================

** Really really understand the question, and ask clarification questions

** Sometimes, it's just helpful to draw the damn array/list/map on paper to visualize it

** If current algo's time complexity is too high, try to increase space (store something useful).

* If looping from start doesn't help, how about looping from the end? Or from both sides?

* Two pointer solution?

* If a problem can be solved recursively, can it be solved iteratively? Can DP be used to optimize it?

* When see a problem that limits to the scope of 26 characters or similar, think of using an array[26]

* When need to use a queue/stack, it's always follows
    1. Initialize the queue/stack with some variables
    2. while queue/stack:
    3. Pop item from the queue/stack, deal with the item
    4. Add more items to queue/stack as needed for next iteration
(For graph traversal, use queue for BFS, use stack for DFS)





Things to Remember
=======================================
Find mid point of linked list
---------------------------------------

slow = head
fast = head
while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

If there are 5 nodes, i will be on 3rd node
If there are 6 nodes, i will be on 3rd node

Traverse graph problems
---------------------------------------
DFS
 - use a stack
 - push first node in
 - `while stack:`
 - pop node out
 - `for nei in node:`
 - do something and push nei to stack
 - use visied to keep track
 - (Can also use coloring to mark nodes if needed)
