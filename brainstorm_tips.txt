BRAINSTORM TIPS FOR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
=======================================

** Really really understand the question, and ask clarification questions

** Sometimes, it's just helpful to draw the damn array/list/map on paper to visualize it

** If current algo's time complexity is too high, try to increase space (store something useful).

* If looping from start doesn't help, how about looping from the end? Or from both sides?

* If a problem can be solved recursively, can it be solved iteratively? Can DP be used to optimize it?
