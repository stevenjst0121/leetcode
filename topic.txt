Data Structures
=============
* String

* Array

* Linked List

* Stack

* Queue

* Heap

* Hashtable
    - TODO Understand how it is implemented

* Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Red-Black Tree
    - AVL Tree

* Graph
    - Directional vs. un-directional
    - Trie

Algorithms
============
* Dynamic Programming
    - Top-down: Recursion + memoization, store resolved subproblems somwhere to avoid duplication
    - Bottom-up: Solve all subproblems first and get the needed answer from store
      (Sometimes in order to build from smallest, need to loop range(N - 1, -1, -1))
    - There is even bi-directional DP, where you construct such an array from both sides.
    - Most of times, dp[i][j] can already represent the result. But sometimes, such as problem 718, the result is max of all dp[i][j]

* Two Pointers
    - TODO

* Binary Search

* Sort

* Bit manipulation

* DFS

* BFS
